# Signal Lost
Minimalist Puzzle Game — Indie-Scale Demo
# Overview

Signal Lost is a minimalist top-down puzzle game created as an indie-scale prototype. The player reconnects broken signal paths by rotating and activating nodes, solving increasingly complex logic puzzles.

Unlike many proof-of-concept demos, Signal Lost demonstrates a high degree of design cohesion, clarity, and polish despite its limited scope.

# Core Features

* Tile-based signal routing puzzles

* Rotation-based interaction mechanics

* Gradual introduction of new puzzle concepts

* Logical difficulty progression

* Clear visual and audio feedback

* Runs locally in the browser (HTML5 Canvas)

# Purpose of This Project

Signal Lost was created to demonstrate game design that prioritizes player satisfaction through:

* Designing self-consistent rule sets

* Introducing mechanics gradually and clearly

* Producing satisfying player feedback loops

* Maintaining engagement through logical complexity rather than randomness

The project serves as a positive example of effective game design at a small scale.

# Technical Details

* Built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript

* Uses HTML5 Canvas for rendering

* No external libraries or frameworks

* Runs by opening index.html locally

# Design Evaluation Focus

This project is used to evaluate:

* Puzzle clarity and readability

* Player learning curves

* Cause-and-effect feedback

* Audio-visual reinforcement

* Extensibility for future content

# Status

✅ Complete Indie-Scale Demo

The core systems are stable and extensible, making this project suitable for content expansion or further experimentation.
